#summary The programming conventions of the Hanami project.
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

While one of Kohanas and our principle is "convention over configuration" this list should give you some advices.

= Accepted Conventions =
  * Follow the [http://trac.kohanaphp.com/wiki/CodingStyle Kohana CodingStyle]
  * Convention over Configuration
  * Using the latest Kohana [http://svn.kohanaphp.com/trunk/system system] and [http://svn.kohanaphp.com/trunk/modules modules]
  * Using [http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/ HTML 4.01 strict]

= Conventions in discussion =

  * validation should be done in the model.
  * Module views are in views/_module_name_/
  * I think it's also wise to enforce a views convention. Best would be the standard controller to view mapping. So 'localhost/blog/post' url will have the view 'views/blog/post.php', 'localhost/blog/' -> views/blog/index.php etc. This will make for a consistent organisation of the view files.
  * What should we use as preferred javascript lib? +1 for jQuery
  * front- and backend have to contain the default route, while modules do not


= HTML =
  * form field names should contain form name, e.g. <form id="login">...<input name="login[username]"/>
